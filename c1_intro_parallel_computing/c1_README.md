# Component 1: Introduction to Parallel Processing / Multiprocessing

There are three notebooks to complete within this component.

1. `c1_a_intro_intel_devcloud.ipynb` will walk you through Intel DevCloud.
2. `c1_b_python_multiprocessing.ipynb` will walk you through Python's multiprocessing library.
3. `c1_c_python_benchmarking.ipynb` will walk you through Python's benchmarking tools.

If you are already familiar with multiprocessing in another language that you wish to use,
you may skip the latter two notebooks, since you can just use your preferred language instead.
